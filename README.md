Multiverse
==========

The most dynamic chat meets the
worldâ€™s fastest meme-generator*

![A meme sample](https://raw.github.com/martinsookael/multiverse/master/public/www/images/memeSample1.png)

Command line based chat, use commands to bring out gif-s and create memes.

It's currently pretty hackable.
I'd love to find the equilibrium between hackable and secure.

Using command line enables fast creation of functionality without being stuck in the design and user implementation phase.
It's easy - you don't have to use any buttons, you use commands.
Espesialy good for tiny screens - like mobile for example.

INSTALLATION
-------------

0. Assuming you have node and npm installed and also bower (`npm install bower -g`)
1. download the package - https://github.com/martinsookael/multiverse/archive/master.zip
or
2. git clone git@github.com:martinsookael/multiverse.git .
3. sudo npm install
4. I tend to get "node-gyp rebuild 2> builderror.log" but nevertheless the stuff seams to work
5. go to conf.js and set "usesDb" to "false" if you don't plan to use database. Also the port can be set from there.
6. `npm start` this also resolves the bower dependencies for the frontend
7. go to yourdomain:3001 or however you configured it.


SETUP
-------------

1. basic configuration and database is in conf.js
2. /public/stylesheets/fonts.styl - I use it to keep several installations with different fonts.

HEROKU:
heroku labs:enable websockets
heroku addons:add mongolab  

DATABASE:
Either start with:  
"USER='xxx' PASS='xxx' HOST='xxx' DB='xxx' DBPORT=xxx COLLECTION='xxx' node t.js"  

or edit conf.js with accurate database credidentials.

(MANUAL) TESTING  
-------------------  

Core functionality:
- create meme  
- create meme with text  
- create shortcut  
- up/down buttons  
- private messaging  
- change rooms (command line / url / front page)  

Functionality:
- "is writing"
- "has seen"
- private message seen
- desktop notifications  
- sound  
- serialwriter - writes seven last messages on log in or on command "l"
- preview  

All yet unnamed fronted functionality, usually won't break:
- url-s to links (broken, looses all of text)  
- images to inline images  
- scroll to bottom of page if something is posted (sometimes broken)  
- working in iframe - like www.multiverse.im/#/r/one?iframe=1  
- m, sc, w, logout, h, l, soundon, soundoff,
- avatars
